sandbox, interim datasets

ideally less than 100 hybrids in each cluster
dynamic tree cutting (paper in google drive)

minimum variables seem to drive the clusters the most



to run a job
cdw (go to work directory)
pwd (print work directory?)
cd Envirotyping/data/..... (wherever it is)
ls (list files in current directory)
ls -lh (list files and size)
sbatch (jobname.sh)
squeue -u azg5169
cat job15(press tab to complete name) will tell error
status PD = pending
dont push files over 50 MB

mkdir -p (overwrites something if it already exists)

vim 'file here'
i ENTER (start editing)

:wq (quit and save changes)

no NAs makes 2015 run.

looking up summary statistics for 3 clusters created by three variables

also want to investigate different combinations. see how we can create two clusters with minimum data
